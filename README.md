RADAR 128

This program for the 128 is a simulated naval radar which could be used in some kind of sub-based game. It uses one sprite for the blip. The routine first draws a circle the hard way in order to be able to store the points in an array for callback later. This program can easily be implemented into a program; for example, the program could control where the sub is and plot it on the radar easily by defining the variables, SA for the angle and SD for the distance from the boat or sub. The best speed at which the radar turns is between 10 and 20. Anything below 5 and it takes forever to go around.
